# Assignment 2:
- In this assignment we were to pick out a simple language and create a lexical scanner and parser for the language. I chose to do a very simple subset of Keyhole Markup Language (KML) which allows users to define placemarkers and give those placemarkers names, descriptions, and coordinates.
